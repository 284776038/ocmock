<h2 id="simplestub">First steps: Using a simple Stub</h2>

<p>The simplest use case for OCMock is the creation of stub objects, that is objects that are set up to return pre-determined values for specific method invocations. 


<h3>The example</h3>

<p>To make this more concrete let's assume we are writing a little application that receives tweets from Twitter. We have a controller class, which for the purpose of this example we just call <code>Controller</code>, and another class that wraps the calls to Twitter's API, which we call <code>TwitterConnection</code>. 
	
<p>The controller has references to the connection and to a view that displays the tweets. It also has a property with which the search term can be set and a method to display the tweets.
			
{% highlight objc %}
@interface Controller

@property(retain) TwitterConnection *connection;
@property(retain) TweetView *tweetView;
@property(retain) NSString *searchTerm;

- (void)displayTweets;

@end
{% endhighlight objc %}	

<p>The interface for <code>TwitterConnection</code> looks like this:

{% highlight objc %}
@interface TwitterConnection 

- (NSArray *)retrieveTweetsForSearchTerm:(NSString *)searchTerm;

@end
{% endhighlight objc %}	

<p>The method takes a search term and returns an array of <code>Tweet</code> objects, or <code>nil</code> if the request could not be handled.

<p>Back in the <code>Controller</code> the <code>displayTweets</code> method looks like this:

{% highlight objc %}
- (void)displayTweets
{
  NSArray *tweets = [connection retrieveTweetsForSearchTerm:searchTerm];
  if (tweets != nil) {
    for (Tweet t in tweets)
      [tweetView addTweet:t];
  } else {
    /* handle error cases */
  }
}
{% endhighlight objc %}	
	
<h3>Why use mocks for the test</h3>  

<p>If we want to test the code in <code>displayTweets</code> we could instantiate a real <code>TwitterConnection</code> and use that. This would lead to a few problems, though:
<ul>
  <li>Using a real connection would make the test slow.
  <li>We never really know what Twitter returns at any given moment.
  <li>It is hard to test the error cases because Twitter usually does not return errors. 
</ul>	
  
<p>The solution to these problems is to replace the connection object with a stub. 

  
<h3>Introducing a stub for the unit test</h3>

<p>Using OCMock we can create a mock object for <code>TwitterConnection</code> and write the test like this:
	
{% highlight objc %}
- (void)testDisplaysTweetsRetrievedFromConnection
{
  Controller *controller = [[Controller alloc] init];

  id mockConnection = OCMClassMock([TwitterConnection class]);
  controller.connection = mockConnection;

  Tweet *testTweet = /* create a tweet somehow */;   
  NSArray *tweetArray = [NSArray arrayWithObject:testTweet];
  OCMStub([mockConnection retrieveTweetsForSearchTerm:[OCMArg any]]).andReturn(tweetArray);

  [controller displayTweets];
}

{% endhighlight objc %}	

<p>The test creates a controller and a mock connection. The controller doesn't know that the connection is not a real connection.
  
<p>The mock connection has a stub for the <code>retrieveTweetsForSearchTerm:</code> method, which is set up to return an array with the test tweet. The <code>[OCMArg any]</code> parameter simply tells OCMock to match all invocations of the method, no matter what argument is passed. We'll return to this later.	
  
<p>When <code>displayTweets</code> is called at the end of the test, the controller calls  <code>retrieveTweetsForSearchTerm:</code> on the connection, which is, of course, our mock that returns the array with the test tweet. So far, so good.


<h2 id="simplemock">Next step: Verifying interactions with a mock object</h2>	
	
<p>In contrast to stubs, which simply provide canned answers, mocks are set up with expectations that form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. In our case they come in handy when we want to ensure that the controller makes the calls to the view.
  
<h3>Expanding the unit test with a mock</h3>

<p>We're adding a few lines to set up a mock view and to verify the controller's interaction with it:
	
{% highlight objc %}
- (void)testDisplaysTweetsRetrievedFromConnection
{
  Controller *controller = [[Controller alloc] init];

  id mockConnection = OCMClassMock([TwitterConnection class]);
  controller.connection = mockConnection;

  Tweet *testTweet = /* create a tweet somehow */;   
  NSArray *tweetArray = [NSArray arrayWithObject:testTweet];
  OCMStub([mockConnection retrieveTweetsForSearchTerm:[OCMArg any]]).andReturn(tweetArray);

  id mockView = OCMClassMock([TweetView class]);
  controller.tweetView = mockView;

  [controller displayTweets];
  
  OCMVerify([mockView addTweet:[OCMArg any]]);
}

{% endhighlight objc %}	

<p>The creation of the mock view is no different from the creation of the mock conntection above and, again, the controller doesn't know that it is connected to a mock and not a real <code>TweetView</code> instance.
	
<p>After calling <code>displayTweets</code> the test verifies that the <code>addTweet:</code> method was invoked. With the implementation of <code>displayTweets</code> shown above the test passes. If we remove the <code>addTweet:</code> call from the <code>displayTweets</code> method then the test will fail, reporting that an expected method was not invoked. In Xcode and AppCode the error is reported on the line of the verify.
  

<h3>Improving the test with argument matching</h3>  
  
<p>This test can be improved. At written above it passes as long as the controller invokes the <code>addTweet:</code> method. The controller could pass a wrong tweet, or even nil, and the test would still pass. To improve this we use a simple argument constraint by modifying the verification:
	
{% highlight objc %}
  OCMVerify([mockView addTweet:testTweet]);
{% endhighlight objc %}
  
<p>This is the simplest argument constraint. The mock object compares whether the object that is passed in the verification is equal to the object that was passed when the method was invoked. Now the verification will fail unless the method is called with the right argument.
	
<p>Apart from the <i>any</i> and <i>equal</i> constraints shown so far OCMock provides a whole set of different constraints. Stubs can also be set up not only to return values but to throw exceptions or post notifications. All of this is described on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/features">features page</a>.
