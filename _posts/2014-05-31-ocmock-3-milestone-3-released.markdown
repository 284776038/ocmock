The third and final milestone has been reached. OCMock 3 is now feature complete. Backwards compatibility should be very high but there have been some changes in the implementation that may result in subtle issues. If you have an existing project that uses OCMock 2, please try this release and report any issues you encounter. You can leave feedback one the [OCMock 3 roadmap](/ocmock3) page or report them via [Github](https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock/issues).
