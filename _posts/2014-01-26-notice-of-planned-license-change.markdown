For OCMock 3, due in Spring, I'm planning to switch the license to an Apache 2 license. Should you have any concerns please get in touch in the next few weeks. **If you have committed code to OCMock**, a quick note <a href="mailto:erik@doernenburg.com"> by email</a> stating that you are okay with the change would be appreciated.
