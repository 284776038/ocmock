While working on a new Objective-C project, a Mac OS X monitor for [DamageControl][], I decide that I've gotten so used to developing test-first and using mock objects that I will bite the bullet and do a simple mock objects implementation in Objective-C. It'll be basic but since Objective-C is so dynamic I probably only need a fraction of the code needed for the Java and .NET versions.
