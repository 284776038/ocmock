Released about a month before the project's 10th anniversary, OCMock 3.0 brings a new modern syntax and support for a _verify-after-running_ testing style. Backwards compatibility with previous versions of OCMock should be very high but there have been some changes in the implementation that may result in subtle issues. For a description of the changes please see [What's new in OCMock 3](/ocmock3).
