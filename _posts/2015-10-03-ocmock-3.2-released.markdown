This release brings a couple of new features and bugfixes for C++ users.  Details can be found in the [change log](https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock/blob/master/Source/Changes.txt). Even though it is built with iOS 9, this release does not yet address the known performance issue with iOS 9 (see [#253](https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock/issues/253)).
