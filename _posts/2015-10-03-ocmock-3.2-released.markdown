This release brings a couple of new features and bugfixes for C++ users.  Details can be found in the [change log](https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock/blob/master/Source/Changes.txt).

We are aware of a perfomance degradation caused by the iOS 9 runtime (see [#253](https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock/issues/253)) but this release, even though it is built for iOS 9, does not contain a workaround. Moving to an older version of OCMock does not help. Building with iOS 8.x does.
