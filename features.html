<h2>Class mocks</h2>
<pre><code>id mock = [OCMockObject mockForClass:[SomeClass class]]</code></pre>
<p>Creates a mock object that can be used as if it were an instance of <i>SomeClass</i>.</p>

<h2>Expectations and verification</h2>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>
<p>Tells the mock object that <b>someMethod:</b> should be called with an argument that is equal to <i>someArgument</i>. After this setup the functionality under test should be invoked followed by</p>
<pre><code>[mock verify]</code></pre>
<p>The <b>verify</b> method will raise an exception if the expected method has not been invoked.</p>

<h2>Stubs</h2>
<pre><code>[[[mock stub] andReturn:aValue] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>
<p>Tells the mock object that when <b>someMethod:</b> is called with <i>someArgument</i> it should return <i>aValue</i>.</p>
<p>If the method returns a primitive type the return value must be wrapped as follows. It is not possible to pass primitive types directly.</p> 
<pre><code>[[[mock stub] andReturnValue:OCMOCK_VALUE((BOOL){YES})] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>

<p>Values can also be returned in pass-by-reference arguments:</p>
<pre><code>[[mock stub] someMethodWithReferenceArgument:[OCMArg setTo:aValue]]</code></pre>
<p>In this case the mock object will set the reference that is passed to the method to <i>aValue</i>, which currently has to be an object.</p>

<p>The mock object can also throw an exception or post a notification when a method is called:</p> 
<pre><code>[[[mock stub] andThrow:anException] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[[mock stub] andPost:aNotification] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>

<p>In fact, the notification can be posted in addition to returning a value:</p>
<pre><code>[[[[mock stub] andPost:aNotification] andReturn:aValue] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>

<p>The mock can delegate the handling of an invocation to a completely different method:</p>
<pre><code>[[[mock stub] andCall:@selector(aMethod:) onObject:anObject] someMethod:someArgument]</code></pre>
<p>In this case the mock object will call <i>aMethod:</i> on <i>anObject</i> when <i>someMethod:</i> is called. The signature of the replacement method must be the same as that of the method that is replaced. Arguments will be passed and the return value of the replacement method is returned from the stubbed method.</p>

<div class="newishfeature">
<p>
If Objective-C blocks are available a block can be used to handle the invocation and set up a return value:</p>
<pre><code> void (^theBlock)(NSInvocation *) = ^(NSInvocation *invocation) {
/* code that reads and modifies the invocation object */
};
[[[mock stub] andDo:theBlock] someMethod:[OCMArg any]];</code></pre>
</div><br>

<div class="newishfeature">
<p>If using a partial mock (see below) it is possible to forward the method to the implementation in the real object, which can be useful to simply check that a method was called:</p>

<pre><code>[[[mock expect] andForwardToRealObject] someMethod]</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that it is possible to use <b>andReturn:</b>, <b>andThrow:</b>, etc with <b>expect</b>, too. This will then return the given return value and, on verify, ensure that the method has been called.</p>

<h2>Argument constraints</h2>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:[OCMArg any]]</code></pre>
<p>Tells the mock object that <b>someMethod:</b> should be called and it does not matter what the argument is. Pointers require special treatment:</p>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethodWithPointerArgument:[OCMArg anyPointer]]</code></pre>
                    
<p>Other constraints available are:</p>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:[OCMArg isNil]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:[OCMArg isNotNil]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:[OCMArg isNotEqual:aValue]]</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:[OCMArg checkWithSelector:aSelector onObject:anObject]]</code></pre>
          
<p>The last constraint will, when the mock object receives <b>someMethod:</b>, send <i>aSelector</i> to <i>anObject</i> and if <i>aSelector</i> takes an argument will pass the argument that was passed to <b>someMethod:</b>. The method should return a boolean indicating whether the argument matched the expectation or not.</p>

<div class="newishfeature">
<p>If Objective-C blocks are available it is possible to check the argument with a block as follows:
	
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:[OCMArg checkWithBlock:^BOOL(id value) { /* return YES if value is ok */ }]];</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Last but not least it is also possible to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/wiki/TutorialObjectiveC">Hamcrest matchers</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] someMethod:startsWith(@"foo")]</code></pre>
	<p>Note that this will only work when the Hamcrest framework is explicitly linked by the unit test bundle.</p>

<h2>Nice mocks / failing fast</h2>
<p>When a method is called on a mock object that has not been set up with either <b>expect</b> or <b>stub</b> the mock object will raise an exception. This fail-fast mode can be turned off by creating a "nice" mock:</p>
<pre><code>id mock = [OCMockObject niceMockForClass:[SomeClass class]]</code></pre>

<div class="newfeature">
<p>While nice mocks will simply ignore all unexpected methods it is possible to disallow specific methods:
<pre><code>[[mock reject] someMethod]</code></pre>
</div>
                                           
<p>Note that in fail-fast mode, if the exception is ignored, it will be rethrown when verify is called. This makes it possible to ensure that unwanted invocations from notifications etc. can be detected.</p>

<h2>Protocol mocks</h2>
<pre><code>id aMock = [OCMockObject mockForProtocol:@protocol(SomeProtocol)]</code></pre>
<p>Creates a mock object that can be used as if it were an instance of an object that implements <i>SomeProtocol</i>.</p>
                                     
<h2>Partial mocks</h2>
<pre><code>id aMock = [OCMockObject partialMockForObject:anObject]</code></pre>
<p>Creates a mock object that can be used in the same way as <i>anObject</i>. When a method that is not stubbed is invoked it will be forwarded to <i>anObject</i>. When a stubbed method is invoked using a reference to <i>anObject</i>, rather than the mock, it will still be handled by the mock.</p>
<p>Note that currently partial mocks cannot be created for instances of toll-free bridged classes, e.g. NSString.</p>
<h2>Observer mocks</h2>
<pre><code>id aMock = [OCMockObject observerMock]</code></pre>
<p>Creates a mock object that can be used to observe notifications. The mock must be registered in order to receive notifications:</p>
<pre><code>[notificatonCenter addMockObserver:aMock name:SomeNotification object:nil]</code></pre>
<p>Expectations can then be set up as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[[mock expect] notificationWithName:SomeNotification object:[OCMArg any]]</code></pre>
<p>Note that currently there is no "nice" mode for observer mocks, they will always raise an exception when an unexpected notification is received.</p>

<h2>Instance-based method swizzling</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, <a href="http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MethodSwizzling">Method Swizzling</a> describes the replacement of a method implementation with a different implementation at runtime. Using partial mocks and the <b>andCall:</b> stub OCMock allows such replacements on a per-instance basis.</a>
<pre><code>id mock = [OCMockObject partialMockForObject:anObject]</code></pre>
<pre><code>[[[mock stub] andCall:@selector(differentMethod:) onObject:differentObject] someMethod:[OCMArg any]]</code></pre>
<p>After these two lines, when <b>someMethod:</b> is sent to <i>anObject</i> the implementation of that method is not invoked. Instead, <b>differentMethod:</b> is called on <i>differentObject</i>. Other instances of the same class are not affected; for these the original implementation of <b>someMethod:</b> is still invoked. The methods can have different names but their signatures should be the same.</p>
