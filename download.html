<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub 
	<span id="cistatus"><a href="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock.png?branch=master"></a></span>

<p>It is built and tests are run by Travis CI. The current status is shown above on the right. If this isn't showing <i>passing</i>, chances are the code is currently not building correctly and we're busy trying to fix it. In all other cases, a local build from source should work.
  
<p>The easiest way to build OCMock from source is to use the supplied build script.
  
<pre><code>cd Tools
ruby build.rb
</code></pre>	

<p>Running this script should create binary versions of the OCMock framework and library in a directory under <code>/tmp</code>. When the build is complete a Finder window for the directory should open up automatically.
  
<p>If you pass the <code>-r</code> flag to the script it creates a disk image with all the artefacts in it. This is what we use to create the binary releases. 
  
<p>If you have switched compilers using the <code>CC</code> enviromnent variable the build might fail. In such cases, please reset the variable before running the script.
