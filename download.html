<h2>
	Stable Releases
</h2>
<p>The binaries require the lowest version of OS X and the iOS SDK that supports all features. It is usually possible to build a given version of OCMock from source for older versions of OS X at the expense of losing some features.

<h2>
	Source code
</h2>
<p>
	The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub
</p>

<p>
	The easiest way to build OCMock from source is to use the supplied build script.
</p>
<pre><code>cd Tools
ruby build.rb
</code></pre>	
<p>
	Running this script should create binary versions of the OCMock framework and library in a directory under <code>/tmp</code>. When the build is complete a finder window for the directory should open up automatically.
</p>
<p>
	If you pass the <code>-r</code> flag to the script it creates a disk image with all the artefacts in it. This is what we use to create the binary distribution. 
</p>
<p>
	If you have switched compilers using the <code>CC</code> enviromnent variable the build might fail. In such cases, please reset the variable before running the script.
