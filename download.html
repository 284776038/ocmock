<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub 
	<span id="cistatus"><a href="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock.svg?branch=master"></a></span>
  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock">https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock</a>

<p>It is built and tests are run by Travis CI. The current status is shown above on the right. If this isn't showing <i>passing</i>, chances are the code is currently not building correctly and we're busy trying to fix it. In all other cases, a local build from source should work.
