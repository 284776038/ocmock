<h2>
	Stable Releases
</h2>
<p>The disk images countain source code and binaries. The binaries are built with the SDKs corresponding to the highest version numbers listed in the platforms field. They are built for deployment on systems that run at least the lowest version listed. It is usually possible to build a given version of OCMock from source for older versions of OS X or iOS, at the expense of losing some features.

	Source code
</h2>
<p>
	The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub
</p>

<p>
	The easiest way to build OCMock from source is to use the supplied build script.
</p>
<pre><code>cd Tools
ruby build.rb
</code></pre>	
<p>
	Running this script should create binary versions of the OCMock framework and library in a directory under <code>/tmp</code>. When the build is complete a finder window for the directory should open up automatically.
</p>
<p>
	If you pass the <code>-r</code> flag to the script it creates a disk image with all the artefacts in it. This is what we use to create the binary distribution. 
</p>
<p>
	If you have switched compilers using the <code>CC</code> enviromnent variable the build might fail. In such cases, please reset the variable before running the script.
