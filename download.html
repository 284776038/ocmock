<h2>Stable Releases</h2>

<p>The disk images countain source code and binaries. Usually the releases can be used on newer systems, too. For example, OCMock 3.1, built with Xcode 6.2 using the OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.2 SDKs, can also be built with Xcode 7 its newer SDKs.

			Recent changes:
			<ul>
					<li>Added macro to tell the mock to ignore non-object arguments.
					<li>Added checks, which throw an expection if no interaction happens with a
						mock object inside the stub/expect/reject/verify macros. This helps in cases
						where by accident the real object is used in these macros.
					<li>Changed stopMocking so that arguments will be forcibly released to break
						retain cycles. This MAY cause some existing tests to fail. However, it
						was always bad practice to use a mock after calling stopMocking.
					<li>Added checks, which throw an exception when stopMocking has been called
						and afterwards an attempt is made to use functionality that will definitely
						not work after stopMocking has been called.
					<li>Changed stub so that return value is not retained if the value is the mock
						itself, because that creates a retain cycle.
					<li>Added support for watchOS

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The source code for OCMock is available on GitHub 
	<span id="cistatus"><a href="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/erikdoe/ocmock.svg?branch=master"></a></span>
  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock">https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock</a>

<p>It is built and tests are run by Travis CI. The current status is shown above on the right. If this isn't showing <i>passing</i>, chances are the code is currently not building correctly and we're busy trying to fix it. In all other cases, a local build from source should work.
	
<p>If you want to build OCMock from source, you must have the <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a> package manager installed.
